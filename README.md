Machine Vision
================

### We will start off with some warm up tasks:
So go ahead and [**Warm yourself Up**](https://github.com/MehdiSaraeian/MachineVision/tree/master/1.WarmUp) with some basic MATLAB coding.

### Start looking through the eyes of computers:
* What are some of the basic features that Machines can see?
* How can we find the [**Corners of Objects**](https://github.com/MehdiSaraeian/MachineVision/tree/master/2.CornerDetection/2.CornerDetection) in our images?
* Where is the [**Edge**](https://github.com/MehdiSaraeian/MachineVision/tree/master/2.CornerDetection/1.EdgeDetection) of that object?
* I have a circular object in my image. How can I find its [**Center and Radius**](https://github.com/MehdiSaraeian/MachineVision/tree/master/2.CornerDetection/3.HoughTransform
)?

### Detecting people with a camera! But how?
How can we use RGB images to [**Detect Faces**](https://github.com/MehdiSaraeian/MachineVision/tree/master/3.SkinColorDetection
)?

### Halftoning! What does that mean?
Basically, computers only understand 0s and 1s. How can we use this fact to [**Print a Black and White Image**](https://github.com/MehdiSaraeian/MachineVision/tree/master/4.ImageHalftoning
)?
